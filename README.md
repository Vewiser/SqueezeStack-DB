# A Fresh Take on Juice Recipes &amp; Data. 


## Overview
This project is an **open-source** application designed to store and manage juice recipes, ingredients, and nutritional information. It features a **PostgreSQL** backend, **AWS** integration, and a dynamic **front-end** to display recipes, filter options, and nutritional information. The project also includes an opportunity to integrate **DeepML** for predictive analysis and recipe recommendations.

***We welcome contributions from developers, data scientists, and front-end engineers to help grow this community-driven project.***

## Why This Project?
The goal is to create a collaborative platform that can be used by various stakeholders—developers, health enthusiasts, and data professionals. This project emphasizes:
- **Data analysis** and **visualization** for exploring juice trends.
- **Microservices** for integration into broader health platforms.
- **APIs** to serve recipe data for external web and mobile applications.
- **DeepML** for advanced predictive analysis, such as suggesting recipes based on health goals or ingredient preferences.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete juice recipes.
- **AWS Integration**: Store images in AWS S3 and use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL.
- **Search & Filter**: Search recipes by ingredients, categories, or nutrition facts.
- **Nutrition Calculation**: Auto-calculated nutrition values for each recipe.
- **Docker Support**: Local development containerized with Docker.
- **DeepML Integration**: Train models on recipe data for recommendation systems or trend predictions.
- **Front-End Interface**: User-friendly web UI with recipe filtering, recipe submission forms, and data visualization.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: 
  - **PostgreSQL** (hosted on AWS RDS) for structured recipe data.
  - **AWS S3** for image storage.
  - **Python** backend using Flask/Django for business logic.
- **Front-End**:
  - **React.js**: Front-end framework for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
  - **Material-UI**: UI library for a modern design aesthetic.
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - **DeepML** models built using **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for recommendations or health insights.
  - **AWS Sagemaker** for training and deploying machine learning models.
- **Containerization**: 
  - **Docker** to ensure consistent environments during development.

## Why Contribute?
We are looking for contributions across **front-end development**, **data science**, and **machine learning**. This open-source project allows contributors to work on real-world applications in health and nutrition while gaining experience in using powerful technologies like **PostgreSQL**, **AWS**, and **DeepML**.

## Use Cases
- **Data Analysis**: Use the database to explore health trends related to juices and ingredients.
- **Visualization**: Visualize recipe popularity or ingredient usage through front-end graphs and charts.
- **Machine Learning**: Predict popular juice combinations, recommend new recipes based on user preferences, or suggest health-focused juices.
- **API Services**: Integrate juice data into broader platforms using REST APIs.
- **Microservices**: Develop juice-related microservices for larger health and fitness platforms.
